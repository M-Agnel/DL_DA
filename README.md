# # Advancing Thyroid Disease Classification using Hybrid CNN-RNN Model

## Abstract

Thyroid diseases, particularly in their advanced stages, present notable diagnostic challenges due to the complex patterns of tissue alterations and the progression of symptoms. This study introduces a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to classify advanced thyroid diseases. The CNN component focuses on extracting spatial features from thyroid ultrasound images, allowing for the detection of intricate visual
patterns associated with disease progression. Meanwhile, the RNN component, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), captures temporal relationships by processing patient clinical history and sequential data, such as hormone levels, heart rates, and symptom progression. By integrating both spatial and temporal
features, this hybrid model aims to offer a more comprehensive understanding of disease stages,leading to improved classification accuracy. The model is tested on a publicly available thyroid disease dataset, demonstrating promising results in
distinguishing advanced from early-stage thyroid conditions. This research underscores the potential of CNN-RNN hybrid models to enhance diagnostic precision and assist clinicians in managing advanced thyroid diseases.

## Objectives

The goal of the ”Hybrid CNN-RNN Model for Advanced Thyroid Disease Classification”
is to improve the classification of thyroid diseases by integrating Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CNNs are employed to extract spatial features from thyroid imaging data, while RNNs, especially Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks, analyze temporal patterns in sequential information. This
combined model seeks to enhance both feature extraction and temporal analysis, resulting in more accurate classifications, fewer false positives and negatives, and improved
diagnostic results, particularly for complex datasets with both spatial and sequential
elements.
